Document Title:
Record of Repeated Account Restriction Following Inquiry About Prior Ban

Purpose:
This document records a case in which a user inquired about a previous account ban,
but received no specific response before a subsequent account was restricted in a similar manner.

Summary:
	•	The user submitted a question regarding the reason for a previous account ban
	•	No clear response from the system was provided at the time of inquiry
	•	When the user accessed the system using a new account,
a restriction was applied again without additional notice
	•	The sequence occurred consistently and without exception

Documentation Goal:
To record the sequence of repeated restrictions applied to the same user across accounts
